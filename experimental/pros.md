PROS is an open source operating system that is meant to run on the VEX V5 cortex. This operating system poses multiple advantages and disadvantages over the stock V5 operating system

## Positives
Some of the potential advantages we may be able to gain by using the PROS operating system for V5 is the ability to use better documentation, as well as to be able to use libraries like tenssorflow in order to create advanced workflows such as using machine learning.
