# PROS

PROS is an open source operating system that is meant to run on the VEX V5 cortex. This operating system poses multiple advantages and disadvantages over the stock V5 operating system

## Positives
Some of the potential advantages we may be able to gain by using the PROS operating system for V5 is the ability to use better documentation, as well as to be able to use libraries like tenssorflow in order to create advanced workflows such as using machine learning.


Some of the advantages are listed below(Not a complete list, this is a set of potential advantages)
- Usage of outside libraries
- Open source, we couls possibly implement/recieve features where we can see the code developed.
- Ability to have a standardized development environment with multiple developers
- More documentation and reference on system API's

## Negatives

Using a non-stock operating system also has some clear disadvantages when compared to that of the stock OS.

Some of the major possible disadvantages with using PROS over the stock VEX OS: 
- Migration difficulty - It would take some time to migrate to PROS.
- Less support - PROS is developed and maintained by Purdie
