# PROS Version

This is the Over Under repository for team **1516B**

We are a VEX VRC team based in the Bay Area, California.

We have both a wiki that covers high-level programming topics along with engineering topics as well as Doxygen documentation for our codebase.

- [Wiki](https://calhighrobotics.github.io/1516b)
- [Doxygen Documentation](https://calhighrobotics.github.io/over_under_b)

We aim to have a cohesive codebase that covers many subsystems but also follows best practices in the C++ development space as well as bringing in new features through modularity.

The codebase is split up into:

```
/include - Contains information about the declarations of various methods and how they would be used
/src - Contains implementation of the above methods and the definition
```
