# PROS Version

This is the Over Under repository for team **1516B**

We aim to have a cohesive codebase that covers many subsystems but also follows best practices in the C++ development space as well as bringing in new features through modularity.

The codebase is split up into:

```
/include - Contains information about the declarations of various methods and how they would be used
/src - Contains implementation of the above methods and the definition
```
