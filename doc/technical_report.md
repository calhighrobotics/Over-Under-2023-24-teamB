abstract: |
    In this technical report, we examine the creation and usage of the program that we have created to run an autonomous program in the 2023-2024 VEX VRC competition. We show the details regarding how the tool was implemented and how the tool executes. Rerun is essentially a function embedded in our greater codebase to provide control for the robot, which repeats a prerecorded path with the same movements, at an accuracy of a couple centimeter inaccuracy. This report will detail the implementation and usage of the program in a programming language-agnostic way, allowing for the tool to be implemented in any other language. The report should be informative and detail everything that the "rerun" prgram aims to do.

# Implementation

    As the VEX ecosystem by defualt provides a moderately closed off set of libraries, it has proven somewhat difficult and time-intensive for us to implement the
